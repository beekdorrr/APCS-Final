The goal of my project was to create an arduino morse code transmitter that sends a morse code message through the serial port, and another program receives and decodes it into a readable message. 

Function: 
- A capacitive sensor is used as the button, and the the duration of each press is recorded as either a dot or a dash.
- The timing/duration of the press is important as to make sure the correct input is recorded
- I wasn't sure how to signify when a word was completed based on timing, so I added a button to be pressed when a word is completed.
- When the entire message is done, another button is pressed to send it over the serial port
